# Write a python code to find the last digit of a number
#Ex    
   #   Input:123456789
   #   Output:9

   #   Input:3572864824
   #   Output:4


# number=int(input("Enter Some Number"))
# last_digit=number%10
# print(last_digit)


#Check wheather a number is even or odd. 
# number=int(input("Enter Some Number"))
# if number%2==0:
#     print("Number is Even")
# else:
#     print("Number is odd")

#Check wheather a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
# number=int(input("Enter a number"))
# if number%3==0 and number%5==0:

# Create a python program that simulates a traffic light system . The user inputs one of the following colors:    
#  "red", "yellow", or "green" . Based on the input, the program should print: 
# "stop" for red ,
# "get ready" for yellow
# "Go" for green

colour=(input("Enter a colour"))
if colour=="R":  #R=RED
    print("STOP")
if colour=="Y":  #Y=YELLOW
    print("GET READY")
if colour=="G":  #G=GREEN
    print("GO")
